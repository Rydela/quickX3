		<h2>Features</h2>
		<p>Below is more details about what makes HXLDash optimised for humanitarians.</p>
		<h3>Quick Mapping</h3>
		<p>HXLDash supports mapping of areas (polygons) and points</p>
		<h4>Area mapping</h4>
		<p>HXLDash is linked to the common operational data sets. If you include Pcodes for in your data set for that country and have the right HXL tag (#country+code,#adm1+code,#adm2+code,#adm3+code,#adm4+code) the dashboard will automatically download the appropriate matching geometry file, link your data to the geometry and produce a map.  Please refer to list of support countries. Geometry files are taken from the UN Mapping Webservice and have been pre-processed to optimise them for web.</p>

		<h4>Point mapping</h4>
		<p>If your data set contains the tags #geo+lat, #geo+lon this will create a point map which can then be styled with data values from other columns.</p>

		<h3>Intelligent Suggestions</h3>
		<p>HXLDash uses the HXL Humanitarian Exchange Language (HXL) tags and a suggestion engine to create charts and maps that make sense for your data set.  These suggestions are then used to build the dashboard in just a few clicks. The suggestions engine reduces the need to have a complex interface to build charts.  We are working on improving the suggestion engine algorithm so if a chart you want does not appear. <a href="{% url 'info' 'contact' %}">Contact us</a> and we'll correct the situation as soon as possible.</p>
		<p>The suggestion engine works by analysing the tags present in your dataset, comparing them against a list of pre defined recipes for charts and maps. If the tags are present then the chart or map is produced.

		<h3>Print Friendly</h3>
		<p>We know that 50% of data products used in the field are on paper.  HXLDash is designed to produced dashboards and maps that print easily on to an A4 piece of paper.</p>

		<h3>Low Bandwidth</h3>
		<p>Humanitarians work in many contexts where low bandwidth internet is the norm.  HXLDash is built with small file sizes in mind with some dashboards coming out as 10% the file size as popular dashboard products.</p>
		<h3>Integrates with the HXL ecosystem</h3>
		<h3>Free and Open Source</h3>
